Store images in a 'local gallery' of sorts, where each image can have a title, rich text description with '#keyword' highlighting, and you can search for images by their title or said keywords.

## How It Works
### Help Tips
- The search bar automatically searches for results whenever you type
- To edit an image you just have to left click on it
- To remove images you have to right click to select it and then click the 'Remove' button, this way lets you remove multiple images

Simple layout with search bar and create/remove buttons along the top and your images with their respective titles along the bottom similar to a file view
